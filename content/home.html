            There's always something new going on, and while this is probably out of date, I'm going to share anyway.
            <br><br>
            Through the better part of my career as a Tech/Team Lead, I've found an overwhelming number of companies and organizations create what they think are teams: 5-20 people together.
            <br><br>
            They do this because they know teams work better. The problem is that those aren't really teams, this are a group. A Team is something you build, nurture, and maintain. But these groups aren't teams, and I've been working on a way to change that, so that you can start building Teams. These create significant value by performing higher and delivering better results than individuals and more impactful than a group of random people thrown together.

            I'm doing this at <a href="https://rhosys.ch" target="_blank">Rhosys</a>, where we create the first toolkit specifically for your team: <a href="https://teaminator.io" target="_blank">Teaminator</a> as well as the most popular standup bot: <a href="https://standup.teaminator.io" target="_blank">Standup & Prosper</a>.
            <br><br>
            We're working on many things, including our latest release, <a href="https://authress.io" target="_blank">Authress</a>, which focuses on application security. It makes Authentication and Authorization easy so you can focus on what matters.
