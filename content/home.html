            There's always something new going on, and while this is probably out of date, I'm going to share anyway. Through the better part of my career as a Tech Lead, I've found an overwhelming number of companies and organizations create what they think are teams. 5-20 people together. Because they know teams work better. The problem is that those aren't really teams, they are a group. A Team is something you build, nuture, and maintain. But these groups aren't teams, and I've been working on a way to change that, so that you can start building Teams. These create significant value by performing higer and delivering better result than individuals and more impactful than a group of people thrown together.  I'm doing this at <a href="https://rhosys.ch" target="_blank">Rhosys</a>, where we are creating the first toolkit specifically for your team: <a href="https://teaminator.io" target="_blank">Teaminator</a>.
