                I'm Warren, and welcome to my space. You're here because you might be looking for some sort of mentorship. Great! I've created this page just for you. In general I offer different kinds of mentorship, so it's important to figure out what you really want and need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, I offer <b>Mentoring, problem solving support, and technical reviews</b> for any sort of work, and this can be in <b>almost any language</b>. I live and work remotely in Switzerland, so the hours will be (CET or CEST). My rates are <b>CHF 50-100/hr</b> (think ~USD/EUR) depending on the level of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A little bit about me</b>: I have 10+ years of sofeware development and architecture experince--teaching, mentoring, and leading teams for most of that. Working with engineers of any level from juniors to principal engineers as well as coaching tech executives. So it's likely I've worked with someone like you.
