		<p><h4><strong>Knights and Knaves</strong></h4></p>
		There is a nightclub on the island of Knights and Knaves, known as the Prime Club. The Prime Club has one strict rule: the number of occupants in the club must be a prime number at all times.
		<p>The Prime Club also has strict bouncers (who stand outside the doors and do not count as occupants) enforcing this rule. In addition, a strange tradition has become customary at the Prime Club: Every so often the occupants form a conga line, and sing a song. The first lyric of the song is:</p>
		<p>“At least one of us in the club is a Knave."</p>
		<p>and is sung by the first person in the line. The second lyric of the song is:</p>
		<p>“At least two of us in the club are Knaves."</p>
		<p>and is sung by the second person in the line. The third person (if there is one) sings:</p>
		<p>“At least three of us in the club are Knaves."</p>
		<p>And so on down the line, until everyone has sung a verse.</p>
		<p>One day you walk by the club, and hear the song being sung. How many people are in the club?</p>
